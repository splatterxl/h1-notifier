# H1 Notifier
A very simple Discord bot to scrape Discord's security shoutouts for any updates. Utilises a naive comparison
algorithm to distinguish changes and posts to a specified Discord channel.

> ⚠️ This program is now obsolete due to the new changes by Discord to their shoutout system.

## Configuration

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Token to use for posting. Make sure to specify `Bot ` prefix before the value.
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL`: Channel to post to.
